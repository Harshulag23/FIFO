# FIFO
This project implements a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory buffer, a fundamental data structure used in digital systems for temporary data storage and transfer between modules operating at different rates.

FIFO is commonly used in:

Data stream buffering

Communication between producer/consumer modules

Clock domain crossing (asynchronous FIFO)

UART, SPI, and DMA controllers

ðŸš€ Features

Supports enqueue (write) and dequeue (read) operations

Parameterizable depth and data width

Flags: Full, Empty, Almost Full, Almost Empty

Optional synchronous or asynchronous implementation

Easy to integrate in larger digital systems
